# About
Some python scripts I used to clear out tweets from my account.
* favorites.py removes most likes before a certain date/tweet.
* get_notifications.py stores all notifications I've received in a MySQL DB table.
* get_timeline.py stores a little under 3k of my tweets in a MySQL DB table.
* get_users.py should have been built into the notifications script. It collections account information of people that have mentioned me.
