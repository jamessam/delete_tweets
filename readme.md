# About
Some python scripts I used to clear out tweets from my account.
* favorites.py removes most likes before a certain date/tweet.
* notifications.py stores all notifications I've received in a MySQL DB table.
* timeline.py is preliminary work.
* users.py should have been built into the notifications script.
